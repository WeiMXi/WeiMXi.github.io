abstract: 'COMET is a leading experiment to search for coherent conversion of µ−N → e−N with a high-intensity
            pulsed muon beamline, produced by the innovative slow extraction techniques. Therefore, it is critical to measure the characteristics of the muon beam. We set up a Muon Beam Monitor (MBM), where scintillation fibers
            (SciFi) weaved in the cross shape are coupled to silicon photomultipliers (SiPM), to measure the spatial profile
            and timing structure of the extracted muon beam for COMET. The MBM detector has been tested successfully
            with a proton beamline in China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) and taken data with good performance in
            the commissioning run called COMET Phase-α. Experience of the MBM development, such as the mechanical
            structure and electronics readout, and its beam measurement results will be shared.'
