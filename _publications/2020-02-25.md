abstract: 'Tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) is a fluorescent material, acts as a wavelength shifter, 
      and can turn UV light into visible light at a peak wavelength of approximately 425 nm, 
      enabling the light signals to be easily detected during physics studies. 
      Compared with a traditional TPB coating method using vapor deposition, 
      we propose an alternative technique applying a spin-coating procedure to facilitate the development of neutrino and dark matter detectors. '
