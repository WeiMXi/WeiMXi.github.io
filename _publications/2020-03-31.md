abstract: 'The flavour symmetry succeeds in explaining the current global fit results. 
      Flavour-symmetry models can be tested by the future experiments that improve the precision of neutrino oscillation parameters, 
      such as the MuOn-decay MEdium baseline NeuTrino beam experiment (MOMENT). In this work, 
      we consider tri-direct littlest seesaw (TDLS) models for a case study, and analyze how much MOMENT can extend our knowledge on the TDLS model.'
