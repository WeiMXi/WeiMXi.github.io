abstract: 'We discuss its sensitivity of measuring the size of nonstandard interactions (NSIs) in matter,
      which can be described by the parameter ϵ<sub>αβ</sub>  (α and β are flavors of neutrinos). We find that the CERNPINGU
      configuration improves 	˜ϵ<sub>μμ</sub>  ≡ ϵ<sub>μμ</sub> − ϵ<sub>ττ</sub> and ϵ<sub>μτ</sub>  significantly compared to the next-generation
      accelerator neutrino experiments. Most of the degeneracy problems in the precision measurements can be
      resolved, except the one for ˜ϵ<sub>μμ</sub>  ∼−0.035. Moreover, we point out that this configuration can also be used
      to detect the CP violation brought by NSIs.'
