abstract: 'The muonium-to-antimuonium conversion experiment (MACE) is proposed to search for charged lepton flavor violation and increase the sensitivity by more than two orders of magnitude compared to the muonium−antimuonium conversion spectrometer (MACS) experiment at PSI in 1999. A clear signature of this conversion is the positron produced from antimuonium decay. This paper presents a near-4π-coverage calorimeter designed for MACE, which can provide an energy resolution of 10.8% at 511 keV, and a signal efficiency of 78.3% for annihilation -ray events. Detailed Monte Carlo simulations using MACE offline software based on Geant4 are performed for geometry optimization, coincidence system design, background estimation, and benchmark detector validation.'
