abstract: 'The flavour symmetry succeeds in explaining the current global fit results. Focusing on the energy threshold, energy resolution, detection efficiency and background suppression in the analysis of electron-like events, we determine whether using opaque detectors could lead to improvements in the CP violation and light sterile neutrino searches in the future accelerator neutrino experiments. We also identify the minimum requirements for the opaque detectors to reach the designated physics goals in the simulated experiments.'
